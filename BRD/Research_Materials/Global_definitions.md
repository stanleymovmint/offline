### Project Polaris (BIS) working definition
The ability to make payments offline means being able to use a CBDC without being connected to the internet, either temporarily or because of coverage limitations.

### Fully offline system
System in which the payer and payee do not need to connect to a ledger system
(though there could be a local on-device ledger) to complete a payment, and 
any value exchanged is immediately transferred to the payee such that they can 
spend it at the end of the value transfer (settlement occurs offline). Both payer 
and payee can stay fully offline without limitation in time

### Intermittently offline system
Similar to fully offline, a system in which the payer and payee do not need to 
connect to a ledger system to complete a payment, and any value exchanged is 
immediately transferred to the payee such that they can spend it at the end of 
the value transfer (settlement occurs offline). However, risk parameters will at 
some point limit the ability of purses to transact and a purse will have to 
synchronise with the central system intermittently in order to continue to 
function.
