### Project Polaris (BIS) working definition
The ability to make payments offline means being able to use a CBDC without being connected to the internet, either temporarily or because of coverage limitations.

### Offline
Not controlled by or directly connected to a computer or external network. For 
CBDC, this refers to being disconnected from CBDC ledger systems, not 
necessarily disconnected from communication networks.

### Offline payment
A transfer of value between devices that takes place without requiring 
connection to any ledger system.

### Staged offline
Where the payer and payee do not need to connect to a ledger system in order 
to exchange value, but the value exchanged is not finally settled on the payee 
until the payee connects to the ledger system. Value transferred to the payee 
cannot be spent until this second stage of online settlement has occurred.

### Offline CBDC system
A payment app or card-based payment system offered by the central bank that 
would not require a continuous connection to CBDC ledger systems.

### Fully offline system
System in which the payer and payee do not need to connect to a ledger system
(though there could be a local on-device ledger) to complete a payment, and 
any value exchanged is immediately transferred to the payee such that they can 
spend it at the end of the value transfer (settlement occurs offline). Both payer 
and payee can stay fully offline without limitation in time

### Intermittently offline system
Similar to fully offline, a system in which the payer and payee do not need to 
connect to a ledger system to complete a payment, and any value exchanged is 
immediately transferred to the payee such that they can spend it at the end of 
the value transfer (settlement occurs offline). However, risk parameters will at 
some point limit the ability of purses to transact and a purse will have to 
synchronise with the central system intermittently in order to continue to 
function.
